This is my personal page built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites).

In [About](about.qmd) you can find more informations about me, in [Projects](posts/index.qmd) you can discover what I am working on and in [Gists](gists/index.qmd) some linux commands I find useful.

Curious about what am I working on? This is a summary of my projects.

# Entanglement phase transitions

In my Master’s thesis, I studied how local quantum measurements affect entanglement growth in one-dimensional fermionic systems.

I developed a numerical framework based on stochastic Schrödinger equations and Gaussian-state formalism to simulate monitored fermionic chains.
By introducing the measurement density $\rho$ as an additional control parameter, I mapped the phase diagram of entanglement scaling and identified volume-law, logarithmic, and area-law regimes, extending known results beyond uniform monitoring.

# Market crashes as critical phenomena

I studied financial market crashes using tools from statistical physics, analyzing the log-returns of the S&P 500 index around the 2000, 2008, and 2020 crises.

By characterizing return distributions, correlations, and volatility, I showed that market dynamics strongly deviate from Gaussian behavior and exhibit fat-tailed statistics.
Using a rolling power-law analysis of return tails, I interpreted market crashes as critical-like regimes where correlations grow and extreme events become more likely, highlighting similarities between financial instability and phase transitions in physical systems.

# Quantum Chaos in Billiard Systems

I studied quantum chaos through the spectral properties of quantum billiards, focusing on the transition from integrable to chaotic behavior. I implemented numerical solvers for the Helmholtz equation using both finite-difference methods and the Expansion Method, validating the approach on a rectangular billiard and extending it to the Bunimovich stadium.
By unfolding the energy spectrum and analyzing level-spacing statistics, I investigated the signatures of chaos predicted by random matrix theory.

# Glass transition

I investigated glassy dynamics using the two-dimensional FA Kinetically Constrained Model, implementing a Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation from scratch.

At low temperatures, I identified the emergence of dynamic heterogeneity through spatial mobility maps, revealing the coexistence of liquid-like and solid-like regions, a key microscopic signature of glassy dynamics.ed that the system does not undergo a true thermodynamic phase transition but exhibits a crossover from Arrhenius to super-Arrhenius behavior.
